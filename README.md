This project is my practice for commits

I will be using this project to help me learn how to become a developer through the Odin project. This will be done by me following instuctions from the lesson.

Added CSS to each page and added a link back to index. All styles are ugly but it is just for practice. Page still looks bad and has not much information. Needs improvent on style aswel.

Improved the styles with adding of margins, borders and padding on all pages. Working is messy, needs cleaning up.
