This project is my practice for commits

I will be using this project to help me learn how to become a developer through the Odin project. This will be done by me following instuctions from the lesson.

Added CSS to each page and added a link back to index. All styles are ugly but it is just for practice. Page still looks bad and has not much information. Needs improvent on style aswel.
